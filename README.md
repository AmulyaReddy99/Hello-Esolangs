# Hello-Esolangs

## Esoteric Language:
**An esoteric programming language (sometimes shortened to esolang) is a programming language designed to test the boundaries of computer programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, as a hacking interface to another language (particularly functional ?programming or procedural programming languages), or as a joke. The use of esoteric distinguishes these languages from programming languages that working developers use to write software.**

## Why Esolang??
**So you've moved past JavaScript tutorials and slinging bad PHP code. You've delved into Ruby a little bit, but discovered you really liked Python. And it wasn't so much that you liked Python for building applications, but you really got into scripting.
From scripting, you started exploring Linux, and that got you all interested in free and open source software, so you started reading about Richard Stallman and the GNU project.
Before you know it you're talking on IRC chat, laughing at all the jokes in every XKCD, and you've read every page of the jargon file. Twice. Now what?
You want to improve your programming skills and your hacker street cred. You've thought about learning C, but that just seems much too useful.
You're hoping to read The Art of Computer Programming, but you've decided to wait until the final edition is available.
So what's the next step? What's the next merit badge on your Geek Scout sash?**
***The answer is Esolangs.***


## About this repo:
**This repo includes *Hello World* programs written in some of these languages. As by convention, the first program written in any language is hello world, these program will lead your path in the worlds of Esolangs.**

## Open to Contributions:
**You can contribute to the repos by adding a better version for the provided esolangs or a Hello world for any other Esolang not already included.**
